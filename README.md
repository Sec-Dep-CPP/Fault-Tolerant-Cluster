# Fault-Tolerant Cluster - Senior Design Project 2024

This repository contains the step-by-step configuration files and Python code for implementing a fault-tolerant cluster as part of the Senior Design Project. The setup includes Nginx for reverse proxying, Keepalived for high availability, Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Alertmanager with webhooks for automated failover processes.
